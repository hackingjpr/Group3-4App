### **Medulloblastoma Group 3 and 4 Tumors Comprise a Clinically and Biologically Significant Expression Continuum Reflecting Human Cerebellar Development**

> *"For convenient comparison, we sub-divided the expression continuum
> (G3/G4-score) into five notional groups:*
>
> *- HighG4 (0-0.2, n=69/223 (31%))*
>
> *- LowG4 (0.2-0.4, n=60/223 (27%)*
>
> *- G3.5 (0.4-0.6, n=39/223 (17%))*
>
> *- LowG3 (0.6-0.8, n=22/223 (10%))*
>
> *- HighG3 (0.8-1 G3/G4-score, n=33/223 (15%)).*
>
> *All samples with \>0.5 G3/G4 score were classified as MBGrp3."*
