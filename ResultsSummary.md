The generated risk plot shows the uploaded sample risk scores relative to a large methylation cohort. Those scores higher than zero are higher than the median value of the external cohort and, pending prospective validation, are thought to indicate higher risk biology. Scores lower than zero are lower than the median value and could indicate more favourable biology. 
As stated previously these scores are for research purposes only and for further information of how these scores could potentially be stratified please see the following publication: paper link.
