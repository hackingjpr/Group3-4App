# Step One - Uploading Data
Upload your idat files (for now unzipped idat files only), including both red and green files.

Upload a minimum of two samples. Increasing the number of samples will of course increase the length of time for the upcoming processes so we recommend ~10 sample batches. This will make looking through the results easier and will speed up the process.

# Step Two - Selecting Metagenes

Select your desired metagene set, this depends on wether you want your risk score to be calculated against ATRT, ECRT, or MRT metagenes.

# Step Three - Generate Risk Values

Press this button:  
  
  ![Generate Risk Values](generate_risk_values.png)  

This will start the process of generating risk values.

# Step Four - Results

Once the calculation has been completed you should be brought to the Results tab. This tab will show a data table at the top which displays your sample names on the left and their risk vaules on the right.

It will also show a graph (as shown below), the details of this graph and what it shows can be found in the corresponding paper (link)  
(insert graph example)  
There will also be a green box in the bottom right which will inform you of the currently selected sample (which will be highlighted in orange on the graph), and the selected metagene set.

# Step Five - Export Data and Reset
Once you have your results you can either reset the app by pressing the reset button:

Or download your data as a CSV file (data table results), or as a PDF (data table and graph).  
**Download functionality is not currently supported but will be by the time the paper is published.**
